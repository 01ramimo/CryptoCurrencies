### Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to apply an unsupervised machine learning model to create a report that details what the top currently traded cryptocurrencies are and how that may be indexed together to create a new investment fund or class for traders and investors as follows:

•	Preprocessing the data for PCA
•	Reducing Data Dimensions using PCA
•	Clustering Cryptocurrencies using K-means
•	Lastly, visualize the results and determine if cryptocurrency is tradable.

### Results

• 3D-Scatter with the PCA data and the clusters
